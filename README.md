My name is Koros Hillary  and I am  currently a GIS and Remote Sensing  Assistant  in the  [Department of Lands,Housing and Urban Planning](https://bomet.go.ke/landshousing-urban-planning/) at the [County Government of Bomet, Kenya](https://bomet.go.ke/).I graduated from Maseno University in 2018 with Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Geospatial Information Science with Information Technology. My expertise includes Geographic Information Science (GIS), remote sensing, Earth Observation and environmental modeling. Specifically, I am interested in applying geospatial big data, machine learning, and cloud computing (e.g., [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), [Geemap](https://geemap.org/), [Geopandas ](https://geopandas.org/)) to  analyze GIS data and study environmental change, especially surface water, temperature and monitor change over time. I am an advocate of open science and reproducible research. More information about my research and career can be found on my [personal website](https://hillarykoros.github.io/) (Last Updated March 2021).
